# CRA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and then ejected in order to fully customize the architecture.

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
yarn test
yarn build
```

---

if you get errors while running `yarn test`, such as `FSEventStreamStart: register_with_server: ERROR: f2d_register_rpc()`, you might need to:

```
brew install watchman
```
